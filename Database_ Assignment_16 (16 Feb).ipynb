    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "-A database is an organized collection of structured or unstructured data that can be accessed, managed, and updated in a systematic way. Databases are used to store and manage data for various applications, ranging from small-scale personal applications to large-scale enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that differ in their structure, data model, and query language:\n",
    "\n",
    "\" SQL databases \": SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL databases store data in a structured manner, using tables with predefined columns and data types. Each table has a unique key, and the data is stored in rows that correspond to records in the table. SQL databases are highly structured and provide a high level of data integrity and consistency. Some examples of SQL databases include \"MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\" NoSQL databases \": NoSQL stands for \"not only SQL\", which means that NoSQL databases are not limited to SQL query language. NoSQL databases store data in a non-structured or semi-structured manner, using documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data with ease. NoSQL databases provide greater flexibility and agility than SQL databases, but at the cost of reduced data integrity and consistency. Some examples of NoSQL databases include \"MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis\".\n",
    "\n",
    "-In summary, SQL databases are highly structured, provide high data integrity and consistency, and use SQL as a query language. NoSQL databases are highly scalable, provide greater flexibility and agility, and use non-structured or semi-structured data models."
